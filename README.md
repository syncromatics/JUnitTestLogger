# JUnitTestLogger

Write a single-paragraph explanation of this project. It should describe what the software does and why it exists. Finish the paragraph with a compelling reason to use the software.

_Consider a spiffy animated GIF or screenshot here_

## Quickstart

This section should get the reader into using the software as quickly as possible. Favor examples over exposistion. For example:

Add the `ThingClient` package to your project:

```bash
dotnet add package ThingClient
```

Then use it to do a thing:

```csharp
var client = new ThingClient.Client();
var result = await client.DoThing();
if (result.HasThing)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"The result is {result.Message}");
}
```

If available, add a link to other documentation for this software. Avoid documenting the entire project in this README.
